Alright, it's time to create your first engine! An engine is just a common interface to a database,
 and the information it requires to connect to one is contained in a connection string,
 such as sqlite:///census_nyc.sqlite. Here, sqlite is the database driver, while census_nyc.
sqlite is a SQLite file contained in the local directory.

You can learn a lot more about connection strings in the SQLAlchemy documentation.

Your job in this exercise is to create an engine that connects to a local SQLite file named census.sqlite. 
Then, print the names of the tables it contains using the .table_names() method.
 Note that when you just want to print the table names, you do not need to use engine.connect() 
after creating the engine.
