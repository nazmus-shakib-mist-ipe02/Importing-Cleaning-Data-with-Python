Excellent work so far! It's now time to build your first select statement using SQLAlchemy. SQLAlchemy provides a nice "Pythonic" way of interacting with databases. So rather than dealing with the differences between specific dialects of traditional SQL such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, you can leverage the Pythonic framework of SQLAlchemy to streamline your workflow and more efficiently query your data. For this reason, it is worth learning even if you may already be familiar with traditional SQL.

In this exercise, you'll once again build a statement to query all records from the census table. This time, however, you'll make use of the select() function of the sqlalchemy module. This function requires a list of tables or columns as the only required argument.

Table and MetaData have already been imported. The metadata is available as metadata and the connection to the database as connection.
