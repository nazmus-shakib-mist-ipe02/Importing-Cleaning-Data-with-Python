In these exercises, you will be working with real databases hosted on the cloud via Amazon Web Services (AWS)!

Let's begin by connecting to a PostgreSQL database. When connecting to a PostgreSQL database,
 many prefer to use the psycopg2 database driver as it supports practically all of 
PostgreSQL's features efficiently and is the standard dialect for PostgreSQL in SQLAlchemy.

You might recall from Chapter 1 that we use the create_engine() function and 
a connection string to connect to a database.

There are three components to the connection string in this exercise: the dialect and driver 
('postgresql+psycopg2://'), followed by the username and password ('student:datacamp'), 
followed by the host and port ('@postgresql.csrrinzqubik.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/'),
 and finally, the database name ('census').
 You will have to pass this string as an argument to create_engine() in order to connect to the database.
