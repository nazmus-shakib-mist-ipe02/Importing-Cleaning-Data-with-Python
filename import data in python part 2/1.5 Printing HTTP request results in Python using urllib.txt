You have just packaged and sent a GET request to "http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation" 
and then caught the response. You saw that such a response is a http.client.HTTPResponse object.
 The question remains: what can you do with this response?

Well, as it came from an HTML page, you could read it to extract the HTML and,
 in fact, such a http.client.HTTPResponse object has an associated read() method. 
In this exercise, you'll build on your previous great work to extract the response and print the HTML.
