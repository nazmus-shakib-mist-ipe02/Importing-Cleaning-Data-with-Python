Now that you know the basics behind HTTP GET requests,
 it's time to perform some of your own. In this interactive exercise, 
you will ping our very own DataCamp servers to perform a GET request to extract information from our teach page,
 "http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation".

In the next exercise, you'll extract the HTML itself. Right now, 
however, you are going to package and send the request and then catch the response.
