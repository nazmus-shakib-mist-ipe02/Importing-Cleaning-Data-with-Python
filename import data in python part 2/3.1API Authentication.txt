The package tweepy is great at handling all the Twitter API OAuth Authentication details for you. 
All you need to do is pass it your authentication credentials. In this interactive exercise, 
we have created some mock authentication credentials (if you wanted to replicate this at home,
 you would need to create a Twitter App as Hugo detailed in the video).
 Your task is to pass these credentials to tweepy's OAuth handler.
