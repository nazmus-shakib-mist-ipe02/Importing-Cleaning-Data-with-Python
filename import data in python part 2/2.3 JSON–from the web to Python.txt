Wow, congrats! You've just queried your first API programmatically in Python and printed the text of the response
 to the shell. However, as you know, your response is actually a JSON,
 so you can do one step better and decode the JSON.
 You can then print the key-value pairs of the resulting dictionary. That's what you're going to do now!
