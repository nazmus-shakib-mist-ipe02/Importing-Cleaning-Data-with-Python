You have just imported a file from the web, saved it locally and loaded it into a DataFrame. 
If you just wanted to load a file from the web into a DataFrame without first saving it locally,
 you can do that easily using pandas. In particular, you can use the function pd.read_csv() with the URL as the first argument and the separator sep as the second argument.

The URL of the file, once again, is

'https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'
