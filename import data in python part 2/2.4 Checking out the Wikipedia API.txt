You're doing so well and having so much fun that we're going to throw one more API at you: 
the Wikipedia API (documented here). You'll figure out how to find and extract information 
from the Wikipedia page for Pizza. What gets a bit wild here is that your query will return nested JSONs, 
that is, JSONs with JSONs, but Python can handle that because it will translate them into dictionaries 
within dictionaries.

The URL that requests the relevant query from the Wikipedia API is

https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&format=json&exintro=&titles=pizza
