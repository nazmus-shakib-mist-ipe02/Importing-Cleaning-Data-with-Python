Now it's your turn to pull some movie data down from the Open Movie Database (OMDB) using their API. 
The movie you'll query the API about is The Social Network.
 Recall that, in the video, to query the API about the movie Hackers, Hugo's query string was 
'http://www.omdbapi.com/?t=hackers' and had a single argument t=hackers.

Note: recently, OMDB has changed their API: you now also have to specify an API key.
 This means you'll have to add another argument to the URL: apikey=ff21610b.
