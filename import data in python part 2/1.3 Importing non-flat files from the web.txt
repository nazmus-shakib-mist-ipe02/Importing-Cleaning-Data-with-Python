Congrats! You've just loaded a flat file from the web into a DataFrame without first saving it locally using the pandas function pd.read_csv(). 
This function is super cool because it has close relatives that allow you to load all types of files, not only flat ones.
 In this interactive exercise, you'll use pd.read_excel() to import an Excel spreadsheet.

The URL of the spreadsheet is

'http://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/course/importing_data_into_r/latitude.xls'
Your job is to use pd.read_excel() to read in all of its sheets, 
print the sheet names and then print the head of the first sheet using its name, not its index.

Note that the output of pd.read_excel() is a Python dictionary with sheet names as keys and corresponding DataFrames as corresponding values.
