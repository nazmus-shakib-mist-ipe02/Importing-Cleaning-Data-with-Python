    "### Resetting the index of a DataFrame\n",
    "After pivoting airquality_melt in the previous exercise, you didn't quite get back the original DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "What you got back instead was a pandas DataFrame with a hierarchical index (also known as a MultiIndex).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchical indexes are covered in depth in Manipulating DataFrames with pandas. In essence, they allow you to group columns or rows by another variable - in this case, by 'Month' as well as 'Day'.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's a very simple method you can use to get back the original DataFrame from the pivoted DataFrame: .reset_index(). We didn't show you how to use this method in the slide, but you're now going to practice using it in this exercise to get back the original DataFrame from airquality_pivot, which has been pre-loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Print the index of airquality_pivot by accessing its .index attribute. This has been done for you.\n",
    "- Reset the index of airquality_pivot using its .reset_index() method.\n",
    "- Print the new index of airquality_pivot_reset.\n",
    "- Print the head of airquality_pivot_reset."
