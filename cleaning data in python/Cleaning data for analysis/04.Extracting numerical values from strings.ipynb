    "### Extracting numerical values from strings\n",
    "Extracting numbers from strings is a common task, particularly when working with unstructured data or log files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say you have the following string: 'the recipe calls for 6 strawberries and 2 bananas'.\n",
    "\n",
    "It would be useful to extract the 6 and the 2 from this string to be saved for later use when comparing strawberry to banana ratios.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using a regular expression to extract multiple numbers (or multiple pattern matches, to be exact), you can use the re.findall() function. Dan did not discuss this in the video, but it is straightforward to use: You pass in a pattern and a string to re.findall(), and it will return a list of the matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import re.\n",
    "- Write a pattern that will find all the numbers in the following string: 'the recipe calls for 10 strawberries and 1 banana'. To do this:\n",
    "- Use the re.findall() function and pass it two arguments: the pattern, followed by the string.\n",
    "\\d is the pattern required to find digits. This should be followed with a + so that the previous element is matched one or more times. This ensures that 10 is viewed as one number and not as 1 and 0.\n",
    "- Print the matches to confirm that your regular expression found the values 10 and 1."
