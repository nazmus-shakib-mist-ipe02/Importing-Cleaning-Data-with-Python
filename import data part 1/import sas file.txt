In this exercise, you'll figure out how to import a SAS file as a DataFrame using SAS7BDAT and pandas. The file 'sales.sas7bdat' is already in your working directory and both pandas and matplotlib.pyplot have already been imported as follows:

import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
The data are adapted from the website of the undergraduate text book Principles of Econometrics by Hill, Griffiths and Lim.
