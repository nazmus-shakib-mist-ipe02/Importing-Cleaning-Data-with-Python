In the last exercise, you were able to import flat files containing columns with different datatypes as numpy arrays.
 However, the DataFrame object in pandas is a more appropriate structure in which to store such data and, thankfully, 
we can easily import files of mixed data types as DataFrames using the pandas functions read_csv() and read_table().
