The file seaslug.txt

has a text header, consisting of strings
is tab-delimited.
These data consists of percentage of sea slug larvae that had metamorphosed in a given time period. Read more here.

Due to the header, if you tried to import it as-is using np.loadtxt(), Python would throw you a ValueError and tell you that it could not convert string to float. There are two ways to deal with this: firstly, you can set the data type argument dtype equal to str (for string).

Alternatively, you can skip the first row as we have seen before, using the skiprows argument.
