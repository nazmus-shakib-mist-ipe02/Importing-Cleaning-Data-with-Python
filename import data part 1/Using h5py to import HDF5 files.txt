The file 'LIGO_data.hdf5' is already in your working directory. In this exercise, you'll import it using the h5py library. You'll also print out its datatype to confirm you have imported it correctly. You'll then study the structure of the file in order to see precisely what HDF groups it contains.

You can find the LIGO data plus loads of documentation and tutorials here. There is also a great tutorial on Signal Processing with the data here.
